I am a MSc student in the field of Artificial Intelligence at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan. My Master thesis topic is *Speech Emotion Recognition Using Pre-trained Neural Models*. I am also a holder of a BSc in Computer Science and studied Acoustics for over two years. My specialty is the implementation of deep learning techniques in psychoacoustics to improve the anthropomorphization of dialogue systems.


## Summary

As an AI enthusiast with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Poznan University of Technology, I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan. I am also actively following my research interests in natural language processing, automatic speech recognition and dialogue systems.

At the moment, I am working on my master's thesis, the main goal of which is to create a model that recognizes emotions in speech based on selected acoustic parameters of sound. By adapting pre-trained neural models to the problem of emotion classification, I hope to achieve satisfactory results for emotionally charged speech in Polish.

In my current role as Assistant Manager, I have honed my skills in leadership, communication, and problem-solving. I have successfully managed a team of employees, ensuring a smooth operation of the climbing wall and a positive experience for customers.

As I seek to transition into a career in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning, I am excited to apply my skills and knowledge to tackle challenging problems and make a meaningful impact.
